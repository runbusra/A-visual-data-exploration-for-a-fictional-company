# A visual data exploration for a fictional company
We are carring out a visual data exploration for ChrisCo, the fictional company whose sales and website
data we have been analysing throughout the module, using a Python Notebook (in Colab or Jupyter).
ChrisCo is a fictional, but nonetheless very successful company managing a range of venues across the UK.
ChrisCo collects a huge amount of data about individual customers visiting its venues using its loyalty card
scheme but this customer data has been aggregated/averaged to give information about the companyâ€™s 40
venues, each identified by a unique 3 letter code (e.g. ABC, XYZ, etc)
